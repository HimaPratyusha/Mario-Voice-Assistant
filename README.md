I have developed a sophisticated voice-enabled assistant named "Mario" that serves as a comprehensive and personalized guide for travellers. Building upon my prior assignments, I have expanded the application's functionality to encompass a range of new intents that facilitate seamless travel experiences for users.
Mario now boasts an impressive collection of six distinct intents, each tailored to address specific travel-related needs. For instance, the "Choose Flight" intent enables users to select flights that best suit their itinerary, while the "Rental Car" intent helps users navigate car rental options with ease. The "Upgrade Flight" intent allows users to upgrade their travel experience, while the "CheckIn Flight" intent enables users to conveniently check in for their journey in line with their travel schedule. Additionally, the "Flight Status" intent keeps users updated on any changes to their flight schedules, while the "Special Assistance" intent provides support to travellers with unique health concerns or other pressing issues.
With Mario as their trusted travel companion, users can effortlessly access a wealth of travel-related information and services at their fingertips. The application's intuitive interface and advanced functionality ensure that users are always up-to-date with their travel plans, making for a hassle-free and memorable travel experience.
